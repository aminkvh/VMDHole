# Release-integrity check.
#
# Builds packaging/vmdhole.zip fresh from source (packaging/make_zip.sh) and checks
# what a "does it run?" test cannot see:
#   * no file shipped twice under a different name;
#   * the version string agrees with itself inside the shipped vmdhole.tcl;
#   * pkgIndex.tcl points at a file that is actually there, at the right version;
#   * the ZIP really contains what was just built (nothing dropped in transit),
#     and carries the Apache notice.
#
# There is no "release copy behind dev" check any more: since the archive is
# built directly from `git ls-files` on every run, drift between "the release"
# and "the dev tree" is no longer a state that exists to check for - there is
# one source tree, not two kept in sync by hand.
